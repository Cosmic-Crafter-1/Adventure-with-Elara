				Elara, with her emerald cloak the colour of spring leaves, crouched low, peering at the deer tracks
				imprinted on the damp earth. Her golden braids, usually adorned with wildflowers, were tucked under a
				worn
				leather cap. Tracking was Elara's magic. She could follow the faintest scent, decipher the language of
				paw
				prints, and predict an animal's next move.

				In the heart of Whisperwood, Elara was known as the best tracker there ever was. But there was one thing
				Elara wasn't very good at - making friends.

				Her fellow elves found her a bit too quiet, spending most of her time alone in the woods. But Elara
				didn't
				mind. She had the company of the rustling leaves, the gurgling streams, and the silent language of the
				forest.

				One crisp morning, as Elara was following a particularly interesting fox trail, she had setup her map
				and
				magnifying glass on the ground.

				Suddenly, a loud, squawking sound shattered the morning peace. Following the noise, she stumbled upon a
				sight that made her emerald eyes widen. Curled beneath a giant oak tree, shivering and lost, was a baby
				griffin.
